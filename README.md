# TeleMonBot
Monitor and log to SQLite your Windows/Linux server via Telegram + ThingSpeak (freaky, yep?)

Python 2,7 script

Used python libraries: psutil, sys, time, datetime, telepot, os, random, httplib, urllib, PIL(Pillow) , PyQt4, uptime, xlsxwriter and peewee

The code is really raw right now... But, well, you can use it and tell me about your experience. My telegram is @E_KOsh. Email e.m.koshmin@gmail.com
